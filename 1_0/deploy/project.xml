		<description>After doing one 3D Flash game for Sony Pictures, they were looking for another one to support the release of the Spider-Man reboot.  For this, we decided to go with a "2.5D" style of gameplay (3D graphics with 2D gameplay).  The game features four unique levels and 17 motion captured "Super Hero Moves" all culminating in a final showdown recreating a scene from the film.    </description>

		<description>With the hopes of creating a new franchise, Universal Pictures wanted a deep interactive experience to introduce audiences to the excitement, dangers, and characters of their film, Safe House.  Existing as a feature on the movie's official website, we built a full 3D interactive experience that followed one step behind the characters, going through several of the locations from the film.  As a writer for this content my goal was to extend the fiction and indirectly illustrate the characters.  As a producer my goal was to get it all done in the two months allotted.</description>
